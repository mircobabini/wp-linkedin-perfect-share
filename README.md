=== LinkedIn Perfect Share plugin for WordPress ===

Provides precise Open Graph data to LinkedIn for perfect sharing

= Issue =

There are a lot of threads pointing out the issue that affects LinkedIn URL sharing. LinkedIn ignores the Open Graph tags provided by the post/page contents even if they are provided accordingly to the Open Graph Protocol. This can become quite frustrating expecially because the provided tags work fine for Facebook, Google+, Twitter and so on – but not for LinkedIn.

= Solution =

LinkedIn Perfect Share detects when LinkedIn is parsing/crawling the Open Graph tags of a post/page and provides a simplified version of the contents. This allows the scraper to see the correct sharing post’s data for the provided URL; the information includes the post title, the description and the Featured Image (that is the standard content for the WordPress’ og:image field).

= Get it now! =

Simply by installing and activating the LinkedIn Perfect Share plugin for WordPress, the LinkedIn crawler will parse the full set of informations for the correct share of page, post or custom posts, including the Post Thumbnail, the title and the excerpt.
