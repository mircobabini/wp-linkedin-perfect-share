Provides precise Open Graph data to <b>LinkedIn for perfect sharing</b>

== Description ==
LinkedIn Perfect Share detects when LinkedIn is parsing/crawling the Open Graph tags of a post/page and provides a simplified version of the contents. This allows the scraper to see the correct sharing post’s data for the provided URL; the information includes the post title, the description and the Featured Image (that is the standard content for the WordPress’ og:image field).
